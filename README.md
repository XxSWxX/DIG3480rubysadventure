# README
The biggest issue i've had throughout the project was Unity getting stuck infinitely while trying to "reload domain" after script modifications. I also had issues with sfx not playing; but it was due to not putting the audio source in the right place.

Team 22: 
Jakob Nelson, Elizabeth Reimann and Thomas Durbin
- Recently sent a message to them and have heard from one of them so far, I will update this README here with any updates in regards to that until the due date
