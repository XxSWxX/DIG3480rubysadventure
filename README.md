# README
The biggest issue I've had throughout the project was Unity getting stuck infinitely while trying to "reload domain" after script modifications, forcing me to close it with task manager and loose progress if I haven't saved just before. I also had issues with sfx not playing; but it was due to not putting the audio source in the right place.

Team 22: 
Jakob N, Elizabeth R and Thomas D
- Recently sent a message to them and have heard from one of them so far, I will update this README here with any updates in regards to that until the due date.
