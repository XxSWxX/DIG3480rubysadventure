# README
For this part of the assignment, I had a big issue with the the pathname for a bundle in the library being too long and I couldn't build. The only fix that worked was copying and pasting everything into a new file. Another issue I had was the build not functioning properly, but this was due to having an object set to "editor only" and a script in the build was trying to reference that object.
